<Layout title="About Me - Ali Mansoor">
  <main>
    <p>
      My journey in programming began during my early university days. As I explored various programming languages and technologies, I naturally gravitated toward mobile development — especially with Flutter — due to its power to build beautiful cross-platform apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the past 2+ years, I've worked on a variety of real-world projects, building everything from digital payment apps to educational platforms and e-commerce solutions. My experience includes working with companies like <strong>Paymo</strong>, <strong>The Essential Studio</strong>, and <strong>GRADE UP</strong>, where I contributed as a Junior and Senior Flutter Developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about building high-quality apps with seamless user experiences. My expertise lies in Flutter, Firebase, REST APIs, and scalable app architecture. I'm also comfortable working with backend stacks like Node.js and Flask, and I enjoy crafting end-to-end solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to my professional work, I actively explore new frameworks and tools, and I enjoy refining my skills by contributing to meaningful projects. I value clean code, good design, and collaborative teamwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of coding, I enjoy football, video games, table tennis, and a good session at the gym.
