    <h2>I've built hundreds of sites and apps. Here are a few of them.</h2>
    <p>
      Within my career, I have worked on variety of Web3 and blockchain relevant
      projects. I have always tried to implement the best and optimal solution
      to the every problem I encounter. With a huge experience in building front
      end applications with <b>React & Next.js</b>, I have worked with
      technologies like <b>NestJS</b> & <b>GraphQL</b> to develop back-end RESTful
      APIs.

      Besides tradional web development, I have also explored <i>Metaverse</i> world
      while developing applications on <b>Decentraland</b> (MANA). with DCL SDK and
      JavaScript physics engines. <br />
      Here are few of the projects, I have worked on
